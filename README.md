## Unsolved Problems And Hurdles
1. HTML Elements in Book Descriptions: Some book descriptions returned by the Google Books API contain HTML elements. A solution to clean these strings is under exploration.
2. Navigation Search Bar: Future enhancements may include a search bar for book titles (from Google API or custom API) and user profiles to improve user experience.
3. Star Rating Styling: Initial challenges with reversing star rating direction were resolved by creating reusable widgets and refining the code for cleaner implementation.
4. Book-Specific Page Challenges:
    - Handling multiple versions of the same book by leveraging unique book IDs in API fetch requests.
    - Aggregating reviews across book versions by adding a "book title" column in the reviews table for better consistency.
